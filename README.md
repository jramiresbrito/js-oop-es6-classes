# Implementing objects using ES6 Classes instead of Prototypes. 

We have some Mosh teaching in classes.js and a Stack DS implementation using ES6 classes.

Is really important to understand that ES6 classes are in Mosh words: "Prototypical sugar syntax".

Once you understand what happens under the hood, i.e, prototypical inheritance, you fully understand ES6 classes.
